# Nginx Server Configs

This is my custom fork of the [h5bp Nginx HTTP server boilerplate configs](https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-nginx).


## Differences

This fork contains a few differences that are tailored for my needs, including:
* A [bash script](enable-site.sh) to enable a site config defined in /sites-available
* Custom configurations for fastcgi in the /custom/fastcgi folder
* [An example PHP site configuration](sites-available/phpexample.com)
